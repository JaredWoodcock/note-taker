# Note-Taker
Module 11 Challenge - Note Taker

In this challenge, I created a "Note-Taker" that met the following criteria:
<ul>When the Note-Taker is opened, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.</ul>
<ul>When the notes page link is clicked, then the user is presented with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and note's text in the right-hand column.</ul>
<ul>When a new note is entered, then a "Save Note" and "Clear Form" buttons appear in the navigation at the top of the page.</ul>
<ul>When the save button is clicked, then the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.</ul>
<ul>When an existing note is clicked in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.</ul>
<ul>When that "New Note" button is clicked, then the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.</ul>
